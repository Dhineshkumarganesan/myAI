Implementing a Image classification neural network to classify Street House View Numbers

Introduction to Neural Network and Deep Learning

SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.

Skills and Tools

Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Keras, Image Recognition

Predicting the Strength of high performance concrete

Featurization, Model Selection & Tuning

This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressor to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance.

Skills and Tools

Regression, Decision trees, feature engineering

Predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures

Supervised Learning

Applied a Classification model like Naive Bayes to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not based on the diagnostic features. Pima_Indian_Diabetes dataset was used to train and test the model on the basis of accuracy matrix values.

Skills and Tools

Classification, Python, Naive Bayes
