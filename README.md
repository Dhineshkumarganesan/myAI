Sentiment Analysis

Natural Language Processing

The objective of this project is to build a text classification model which analyses the customer's sentiments based on their reviews in the IMDB database. The model uses a complex deep learning model to build an embedding layer followed by a classification algorithm to analyse the sentiment of the customers.

Skills and Tools

RNN, Word Embedding, LSTM, Classification

Face Recognition

Computer Vision

Face recognition deals with Computer Vision a discipline of Artificial Intelligence and uses techniques of image processing and deep learning. The objective of this project is to build a face recognition system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces.

Skills and Tools

Computer Vision, Keras, CNN, Siamese Networks, Triplet loss

Implementing a Image classification neural network to classify Street House View Numbers

Introduction to Neural Network and Deep Learning

SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.

Skills and Tools

Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Keras, Image Recognition

Predicting the Strength of high performance concrete

Featurization, Model Selection & Tuning

This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressor to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance.

Skills and Tools

Regression, Decision trees, feature engineering
